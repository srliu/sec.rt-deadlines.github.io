### Deadline format

Deadline field can contain:

1. The simplest option: a date and time in ISO format. Example: `"2017-08-19 23:59"`.
2. If a deadline is rolling, you can use a template date, just substitute year with `%y`, or month with `%m`. Example: `"%y-%m-15 23:59"` means there is a deadline on the 15th day of every month, every year. `"2017-%m-15"` means a deadline on 15th day of every month, but only in 2017, i.e. `"2018-01-15"` is not a part of this template.
2. A list of (1) or (2). Example of two rolling deadlines, with one in the end of May every year, and the second in the end of February:
  ```
  - "%y-05-31 23:59"
  - "%y-02-28 23:59"
  ```

On the page, all deadlines are displayed in viewer's local time (that's a feature).

*Note:* If deadline hour is `{h}:00`, it will be automatically translated into `{h-1}:59:59` to avoid pain and confusion when it happens to be midnight in local time.

### Timezones

Timezone is specified in [tz format][1]. Unlike abbreviations (e.g. EST), these are un-ambiguous. Here are tz codes for some common timezones:

| Common name                   | tz                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UTC                           | `Etc/UTC`                                                          |
| America Pacific Time          | `America/Los_Angeles`                                              |
| Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8) | `Etc/GMT+8` (Yes, the sign is inverted. I know.)                   |
| America Eastern Time          | `America/New_York`                                                 |
| Eastern Standard Time (UTC-5) | `Etc/GMT+5`                                                        |
| American Samoa Time (UTC-11)  | `Pacific/Samoa` or `Etc/GMT+11`. This timezone does not use DST.   |
| Aleutian Islands              | `America/Adak`                                                     |
